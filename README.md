# meeting notes
## Conventions
+ Meeting files are to be written using markdown.
+ Meeting files will be named using `YY-MM-DD` notation
    (though ISO 8601 may be more approriate).
    - Example `17-11-1`
+ Meeting folders are named using `SEASON-YYYY` then year. Where
    `SEASON` must be in `{Fall, Spring, Summer}`.
    - Example: `Fall_2017`
