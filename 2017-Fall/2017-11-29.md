# Notes
1. Media Page
    - Swipe on mobile platforms
    - Slow on load
    - Stall
    - When js is blocked everything turns white
        - Have JS dynamically load images
            - as aposed to dynamically spacing which is **expensive**
2. Attendance/~~RSVP~~/Paid events/Priority
    - Miner LAN absorbed into Priority
    - Events: The main purpose of the website is to show events
    - Attendance: QRcode? Type a Key?
        -Need some type of proof or way to send out details easily
    - Paid Events
        - Integraty
            - Make sure ACM Officers can't inflate participation
        - If an event costs more than $0 we want to have a signups, just like
        with memberships, and accept creditcard payments through our site.
        - Deal with cash payments manually
            - Give event manager's information
        - Roll call is too slow
        - QRcode blocks people without phones
            - Add to Partisipation table
        - A computer at the front creates a bottle neck
            - Add to Partisipation table
        - RSVP
            - Give more input on the event (pizza toppings)
            - Comments about event
    - Priority
        - 0: major events and should be at the top of the front page
        - n > 0 will just rearange possition on page
3. meeting time
    - Next week meeting time postponed
4. Docs
    - Beginner guides
        - git
        - How to work with sigdotcom
        - how to vagrant
        - Our philosophy
    - revisit auto-docing
    - Explain what each app is for
    - Explain the step associated with each portion of code
5. Permissions
6. Homepages
    - Next major front end step
    - Like orgsync but under our philosophy
    - Purpose of sig homepage
        - Admin: Manage sig/members
            - Sending mass emails
            - Manging events
        - To a User: Biographic of sig
            - what it dose
            - what it's about
8. Tools
    - Done
        - Right now the only tool we have is _memebership_
            - Main point is to determine if a user is an ACM memeber so that we can
            easily do event checking.
    - TODO
        - Search box
            - Fuzzy match
            - Use filters to find if a name/email pair match with given regex
            - Optional: update as search term is added
        - Edit Button
            - Delete membership
                - Set experation date to `null` or todays date
            - Extend memebership
                - change `membership_exeration` date
        - Authenticate
            - Issue: access our backend without giving access to everyone
            - we will need a key to stop people from editing
            - Login with proper permissions to veiw api
            - Or an API key (intended for autonomous agents)
