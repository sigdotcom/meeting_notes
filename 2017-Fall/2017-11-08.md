## Membership

+ Mobil view complete
+ we need a template for 500 request

### Testing with stripe
+ automatically accept any credit card with n 42's
    - anything added after that will work

## Migrations
+ A programmatic tool that allow for transitions for database state
+ They help preserves data without manual interaction.
+ They give Django a procedural way to change database
+ The way we utilize migrations
    - Start from an empty database
    - Automatically add scheme layout (migration 001)
    - User adds data to data base (migration 002)
    - At any point you can assume that migration 001 and 002 will
    exist
+ Our goal is to have as minimum production migrations as possible
but on your own development build you can have any migrations as
necessary.
+ Ideally we will only build up and add new migrations rather than
going back and edit old migrations.
