# First design meeting
## Backend
1. Permission
    - API: We need to link our permission system with our API so we can have
    more flexablilty with our data while still maintaining safty.
    - Create a secure front/back-end connection to keep sensitive/private
    information safe.
    - Group based permissions where a user can be in multiple groups.
        - We want to allow a differentiat the access that members of different
        sigs don't have access
2. Event Tagging
    - We don't have a way to tag events currently. Giving events tags based on
    what they're about so we can infere things about the events and filter them
    out accordingly.

    - We Use [stripe](https://stripe.com/docs) to deal with payments

## Frontend

2. Events
    - Major Events
        - Wall of events
    - "Premium" Events (RSVP Event)

        events that go on the front page.
